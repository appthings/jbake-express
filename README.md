# jbake-express


Download and jbake -b. There is no other step.
Use any http server you know, recommended default is Caddy|Wedge.

Assumes prior knowledge and experience in one of Markdown(.md), Sass/Less, Jade/Pug, asciidoctor or similar. Use any, ex: Bootstrap, Foundation, Semnatic, MUI, etc. If you are not familar with those - 'jB X' may not be the best choice for you. We care about typography, vertical rhythm, letter-spacing, micro interactions, and more. We work great with GSAP|threejs and similar js libraries. Recommended default is Framework 7 CSS (it uses'less' sadly, not Sass).

USP:
- #1: Designed so that you can one day host it. It's just static files. You have FTP access to just copy and host by self - with our support, that is included! We just ask for a linked in testimonial stating if we were helpfull to migrate of our hosting (AWS default).
- Mobile first! We have an app example to show you. ( Also happy to use all the latest mobile features )
- Bootstrap, Foundation, Semnatic, Material UI, Framework 7 are free. Others are extra. We match *YOUR* org style/ookl, by *YOUR* designer. 
- You can use any editor, ex: VS Code.  
- Fast FTS, with type ahead, included.
- CDN included
- On the flu image sizing service included.
- When you connect, content is cached in the browser. You can read on the subway. (dynamic html manifest)
- HTTPS / Certs included
- SEO / Google analytics
- Admin via FTP or via Web Admin interfaces (that updates content files ) 
- Monitoring, of course.
- Custom app development at $50 / hr at weekly increments, ex: reqs or prototype. Or fix bid ~ $800 per page/'slide' at 4 page increments after reqs. We do very nice forms and 'master/detial' work flow. API/Services only without DB back end is 10% discount. Interactive banner ads at $400 per set for standard sizes. (We don't do static ads, maybe at some crazy high rate) Development targeting Awwwards are 50% discount.
- Support popular ad systems - without interfearing with web app UX.  
- Native Android, native IOS and native Windows app is $0. Support for ie11 is 15% extra.
- Option to generate/view as PDF of select content/posts at 20% extra. 
- Migration service: from your CMS or WP to 'staticly generated' CMS is $200 / page/post/slide.
- $60 / month hosting (includes CDN, image service, support, your dedicated AWS instance)
- If you only want some of our service: GREAT! Pick and chose what you want others to do. We can just be your defualt or back up/insurance.
** - We must add shoping cart ASAP!!!!!! XXX
Compare to WP Express

Why?:
- I used Wordpress for my prior company. Found that team strugled to edit/style. And it produced 'nasty' HTML.  
- Java is the most popular lang, not PHP. But you just need to know markdown, Sass/Less, Jade/Pug or similar. We default use Jade/Pug, it is cross tool popular.

Notes: 
- prototype folder will be deleted, it's just for initial style.
- Git will ignore css and html files, of course. And the wedge server executable is also ignored.
- I'll work in service folder for the jB Mobi services. Later admin services.


Scope:
1. Find 4 articles on web that you can link to. Write 2 in md and 2 in asciidoc, just 2 sentances and a link to the article. Should be related to design or static sites or such. Need 4 articles so we can have pagination/archive. Each article (2 sentances) should also include an external image. (for part 2). Host. Via CDN. HTTPS via wedge.
So I can write my API. I'll point the 'jB X' domain to it. On critical path. Put in git at least daily.
2. Glance F7 tutorial, it is maybe 3 pages. tWrite a website in Jade, Framework 7 / less in prototype folder. Similar to WP Express and such, use some USP ideas from above or better: yours, including pricing. Should have a 'landing/seo page/index/home', and a working accept payment|send invoice with that one per page jquery I like. Ads some of the USP here. Header on top should be black for the osx notch. Use some icons, I like the star logo. Maybe we should be jB star domain? OK, I bought the jbakestar.com. :-)
For any forms use gridforms in assets. You'll see why.
To theme F7, use the local less file in assets, and not CDN. It's obvious. 
Use tabs, not spaces in source please. We are not savages.
I recommend you use prepros.io in prototype while you 'layout' the site.
(see  shoping cart note)
We split 50/50 monthly after direct costs and taxes. (Direct costs is hosting, or customer consulting internal rate / 50% of external rate)
3. Migrate prorotype to templates(ex: cut up header/footer). Modify templates so jb generates blog.html. 
3.5 Delete everything in assets folder. In assets, create an assets folder (nested) so it looks nice when generated. ex: /assets/assets/images ends up in /public/assets/images. Any libs that are on jdeliver, use them from there, no need to mess. Copy our assets that we can't get from other people's CDN to /asets. 

Phase 2.
4. Test with ie11 and mobile support. Some light support. Delete prototype folder.
4.5 Port another of your sites to jB7. 
5. Write some google ads. $10 / month, you pay. ~ $120/year
6. Draft a spam email. Buy a mail list and use a mailing service (don't mail from your/our domains). I recomend you don't use html emails, but use text. Ex: $200,  we split. Every qtr buy a list ~ $800 / year.
7. Check SEO using google web admin tools. Check google analytics. Check ad performance. Add site monitoring. 
8. See how we do image size in .md and asciiD articles. So they show up nice when generated. One option is inlines html somehow. I'll work on this as well.
9. Place an ad on blog page/post, when they see a single one.
10. Link to 'jb Mobi' blog reader on menu, once my API works. 
10.5. Talk to jb guy, get a 'Framework 7' theme posted (this git)
11. Touch up jb Mobi
12. Place jB mobi phonegap app in app stores (android, apple and windows 10 app store). 
13. Move hosting to AWS. Should be same/cheaper than DO. We split. CDN - you pay, since you have it? AWS sometimes has 'free $200' cupon for start ups. On we work or F6S, gust.

Phase 3
- Clean up git, ex this file.
- Fill out our company on F6S and gust. We WILL get this funded! I plan to move back to CA for this (
 http://crunchbase.com/organization/weebly
 
 http://crunchbase.com/organization/wix
)
- AMP version  of blogs, light!!!!
- Integrate FTS/type ahead into site like jbMobie via a search field once ready.
- open a bank account. I'll tell you banker to use.
- get a lawyer. A major law firm. THey do free for start up first year. To create Dellware corp with LOTS of shares. So we can give advisors 20K shares and not impact. We can ask around. 
- pick company name. I use http://nameboy.com I'm fine w/ varation of red cap . 
Our mission is: we are not inovative, we just coppied a working model and we can execute on it. We plan to raise just over $20M. (data shows > 20M and company makes it. ) In 3 rouunds, last one is $17M, second one is $3M. first one is $250K. In first round we will spend $5K per month on google ads and spam for 3 years: till our second round. Following round, same, we just spend more on ads and spam.

I'll also work on the admin page that writes the content files. Admin password will be hard coded in a file.



Note: - pick shoping cart, ex:
http://docs.snipcart.com/getting-started/installation

http://simplecartjs.org/features

If they offer we web site, that eliminates them. We just want a vendor to use that has a shoping cart.
